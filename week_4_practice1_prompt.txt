Modify the guessing-game program so that the user thinks of a number that the computer must guess.

The computer must make no more than the minimum number of guesses, and it must prevent the user from cheating by entering misleading hints.
Use I'm out of guesses, and you cheated and Hooray, I've got it in X tries as your final output.
(Hint: Use the math.log function to compute the minimum number of guesses needed after the lower and upper bounds are entered.)

Below are two test runs of the program:

Enter the smaller number: 0
Enter the larger number: 10

0 10
Your number is 5
Enter =, <, or >: <
0 4
Your number is 2
Enter =, <, or >: >
3 4
Your number is 3
Enter =, <, or >: =
Hooray, I've got it in 3 tries!
Enter the smaller number: 0
Enter the larger number: 50
0 50
Your number is 25
Enter =, <, or >: <
0 24
Your number is 12
Enter =, <, or >: <
0 11
Your number is 5
Enter =, <, or >: <
0 4
Your number is 2
Enter =, <, or >: <
0 1
Your number is 0
Enter =, <, or >: >
1 1
Your number is 1
Enter =, <, or >: >
I'm out of guesses, and you cheated!
